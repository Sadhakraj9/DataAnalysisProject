Introduction
In this project, we aim to gain insights into movie popularity by analyzing various attributes such as vote count, average vote, release year, and more. By applying data preprocessing techniques, visualizations, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling, we seek to understand the underlying factors that contribute to a movie's popularity.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains movie information, including attributes such as title, overview, original language, release date, genres, popularity, vote average, and vote count.

Project Steps
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and creating relevant features.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to explore the relationships between popularity, vote average, and other attributes.
Advanced Analysis: Applying hypothesis testing to verify relationships and patterns.
Regression Modeling: Developing a linear regression model to predict vote averages based on popularity and vote count.
Results: Interpreting the findings and summarizing insights obtained.
Data Preprocessing
We handle missing values, create new features like 'release_year', and calculate 'popularity_ratio' to enhance our analysis.

Data Visualization
Using various visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps), we explore trends and relationships between popularity, release year, and other features.

Advanced Analysis
We perform hypothesis tests to confirm or reject relationships observed in our visualizations, such as differences in vote averages across genres.

Regression Modeling
We build a linear regression model to predict vote averages using 'popularity' and 'vote_count' as predictors, evaluating its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

Results
Our analysis sheds light on the factors influencing movie popularity and their relative impact. The regression model provides insights into the relationship between popularity, vote count, and vote average.
